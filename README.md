# Live (GitHub-Flavored) Markdown Editor

## Important Note

We're migrating. This fork would soone be merged back to `jbt.github.io` with most of the features added. Before that, there is a list of issues that need to be resolved. [Contributions welcome](https://github.com/aero31aero/markdown-editor/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Amerge-blocker)!

## Usage

[Use it here](//jbt.github.io/markdown-editor). The live markdown reader will display a preview as you type.

Feel free to take the code and copy it and modify it and use it however you like. (If you really want a licence, see [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/txt/copying/))
